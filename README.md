A Multispectral Satellite Image Dehazing Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project aimed at enhancing the clarity of multispectral satellite images by removing haze and atmospheric effects.

Introduction

Haze and atmospheric distortions significantly degrade the quality of satellite imagery, hindering accurate analysis and interpretation. This project explores effective dehazing techniques specifically tailored for multispectral satellite data.

Project Goals

Develop and implement robust dehazing algorithms for multispectral satellite images.
Evaluate the performance of different dehazing methods using quantitative metrics and visual assessments.
Investigate the impact of dehazing on downstream applications such as land cover classification, change detection, and vegetation monitoring.
Key Features

[List key features of your implementation, e.g.,]:
Support for various multispectral image formats (e.g., GeoTIFF, ENVI).
Integration with popular remote sensing libraries (e.g., GDAL, Rasterio).
Implementation of state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms (e.g., Dark Channel Prior, Multi-scale Retinex).
Interactive visualization tools for comparing original and dehazed images.
Comprehensive documentation and tutorials.
Getting Started

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/[repository_name].git
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt 
[Optional: Download and prepare sample data]

Run the dehazing script:

Bash

python dehaze_script.py --input_path [input_image_path] --output_path [output_image_path] 
Documentation

[Link to documentation (e.g., a Jupyter Notebook or a dedicated documentation website)]
Results

[Include visual comparisons of original and dehazed images. Consider using a table or a gallery of images.]
[Present quantitative results (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and discuss their implications.]
Future Work

[Outline potential future directions for the project, e.g.,]:
Explore deep learning-based dehazing methods.
Develop a user-friendly graphical interface.
Integrate dehazing into a larger remote sensing workflow.
